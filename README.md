# abandonedsb
my abandoned selfbot project, maybe good for the foundations of your own selfbot

# how to use
make sure you download node https:/nodejs.org
run npm install
make sure to put your user token and prefix in the config.json file (MAKE SURE YOU SAVE THE FILE)
open a terminal and run node .
selfbot is up!

you may need to install the discord.js-selfbot-fix so you dont crash when your added to groups (its on my github)
